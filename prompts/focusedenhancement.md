# Focused Enhancement and Specification
The 'Focused Enhancement and Specification' category of AI prompting techniques encompasses methods that concentrate on refining and enhancing specific aspects or elements of a task. This group includes Focused Language Action and Reasoning Enhancement (FLARE), Directive Prompting, and Contextual Prompting. Each technique within this category is tailored to direct the AI's attention to particular details or contexts, ensuring a high degree of precision and specificity in the responses. FLARE intensively analyzes particular aspects to provide in-depth insights, while Directive Prompting offers clear, concise instructions for focused analysis. Contextual Prompting, on the other hand, enriches the task with relevant background information, enabling a more holistic understanding. These techniques are especially valuable in situations where detailed exploration, adherence to particular guidelines, or a comprehensive contextual understanding is essential. They are well-suited for tasks that demand a nuanced approach, such as creating detailed and contextually rich descriptions of artworks for visually impaired audiences.

| Technique                         | Rating (1-5) | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------------------------------|:------------:|-----------|------------|
| Focused Language Action and Reasoning Enhancement (FLARE) | 4 | Detailed analysis of specific aspects; provides depth and nuance. | Requires careful planning; might miss broader context. |
| Directive Prompting               | 2            | Precise and focused descriptions; good for specific guidelines adherence. | May overlook broader or interconnected elements. |
| Contextual Prompting              | 3            | Incorporates rich background information, enhancing overall understanding. | Risk of focusing too heavily on context over direct description. |

_Rating is usefulness for artwork description, 1 = least useful, 5 = most useful._

## Baseline Instruction
> "Describe the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh."

## FLARE Instruction:

- **Focus:** FLARE is about directing the AI's attention to specific aspects or elements of a task, enhancing the reasoning and articulation based on those focused areas.
- **Application:** This technique is useful for tasks requiring detailed analysis or emphasis on particular features. It's ideal for providing in-depth descriptions or explanations of specific aspects.
- **Weaknesses:** May require careful planning to ensure all relevant aspects of the artwork are covered. Might not inherently encourage a holistic or interconnected view of the artwork.
- **Example:** In the context of art description, a FLARE approach would guide the AI to focus sequentially on different aspects of 'Starry Night', such as the color scheme, brushwork, and emotional impact. This method ensures that each element is explored in depth, providing a rich and detailed understanding of the artwork's key features.
- **Complexity:** Moderate to High. Involves directing the AI to focus on and enhance specific aspects of the task, requiring a nuanced understanding of the task’s requirements.

> "Using the Focused Language Action and Reasoning Enhancement (FLARE) approach, describe the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh with an emphasis on specific elements. Concentrate first on the color palette and brushwork techniques used. Next, focus on the spatial arrangement and the emotional impact conveyed by these elements. Each part of your description should enhance the understanding of these particular aspects, providing a detailed and nuanced perspective of the artwork."


## Directive Prompting Instruction:

- **Focus:** Directive Prompting centers on providing clear, direct instructions to guide the AI's response, focusing on specific tasks or aspects.
- **Application:** This technique is effective for tasks where precision and adherence to specific guidelines are important. It ensures that the AI concentrates on designated aspects, leading to targeted and specific descriptions.
- **Weaknesses:** Risk of missing broader context or interconnected elements of the artwork if the directives are too narrowly focused.
- **Example:** In the context of art description for 'Starry Night', Directive Prompting would lead the AI to address each instructed aspect in turn – color usage, brushwork, and mood conveyance. This method ensures that the AI's description is focused and aligns closely with the provided directives, offering a detailed examination of the specified features of the painting.
- **Complexity:** Low to Moderate. Involves giving direct and specific instructions to the AI, which can be straightforward but may require precision in the formulation of directives.

> "Using Directive Prompting, describe the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh. Focus specifically on the following aspects: First, describe the use of color, highlighting the dominant hues and their effect. Next, detail the brushwork and its contribution to the texture of the painting. Finally, explain how these elements combine to convey the mood of the artwork. Follow these directives closely to provide a clear and specific analysis of each aspect."

## Contextual Prompting Instruction:

- **Focus:** Contextual Prompting involves providing a rich background or contextual information before diving into the specific task. It helps in framing the response within a broader context.
- **Application:** This approach is particularly useful for tasks where the background information significantly enhances understanding or interpretation. It encourages a more holistic view of the subject.
- **Weaknesses:** If not well-balanced, the AI might focus too heavily on the provided context at the expense of other important details of the artwork itself.Example: In the context of art description, particularly for 'Starry Night', the Contextual Prompting method would guide the AI to incorporate van Gogh's personal circumstances and the historical backdrop into its description of the painting. This approach helps in painting a more vivid and informed picture of the artwork, considering not just its visual aspects but also the emotional and symbolic implications rooted in its context.
- **Complexity:** Moderate. Requires providing detailed context before posing specific questions or tasks, necessitating a good grasp of the relevant background information.

> "Before describing the painting 'Starry Night' by Vincent van Gogh, consider the context in which it was created. Vincent van Gogh painted 'Starry Night' in 1889 while in an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence. With this context in mind, describe how the swirling patterns of the sky might reflect van Gogh's emotional state and the isolation of his surroundings. Then, consider how the bright stars and moon contrast with the somber village below, reflecting on what this contrast might symbolize about van Gogh's perspective on the world."
