## Inquisitive Prompting

- **Focus:** Inquisitive Prompting revolves around the use of questions to guide the exploration and analysis of a subject. It’s about uncovering deeper insights through inquiry.
- **Application:** This method is particularly effective for tasks that benefit from a deeper level of understanding or when exploring various interpretations. It encourages a more thorough and thoughtful examination of the subject. Particularly adept at uncovering more nuanced or less obvious details of an artwork.
