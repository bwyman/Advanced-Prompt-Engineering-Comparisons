# Accessibility and Image Descriptions

## Alt Text and Image descriptions
It's important to note that there are two kinds of text that are relevant in describing artworks — alt text and image descriptions. It's likely that the field ultimately needs both variations in our collections databases. While these can easily overlap, alt text is at a minim a subset of the image descriptions. 

- **Alt Text:** In which we're creating short descriptions for use as alt text for web images, social media, etc. Typically, these are be 2-3 sentences, being fairly concise, and narrowly factual. Its main function is to focus on the crucial information that needs to be conveyed about the image. 
	
- **Image Descriptions:** These are substantially longer and more detailed that alt text. These descriptions provide more detail, content, and context — not only for visually impaired users, but as descriptions that universally benefit a general audience. These are typically a paragraph or two in length and are more comprehensive including details about colors, layout, mood, style, and any significant elements in the image. For artworks, this might include artistic techniques, symbolism, and historical context.

## Rules for Image descriptions
There is a plethora of information around best practices in describing images. I pulled from multiple sources across the web including:

And, in turn fed these into a CustomGPT that was configured as an accessibility expert to extract the following, which, based on personal experience, seem to cover a pretty broad spectrum of things I've experienced in parts and pieces. These have broken into three tiers of priority, to give some sense of overall order and important.
